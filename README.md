I've set up my own [Github Codespace](https://cuddly-memory-6jxwq75rxp92599r.github.dev/), pre-installed with essential TypeScript packages.

Regrettably, Codespace can't be publicly shared without [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare). If you prefer working on it instead of your local machine, let me know. I'm glad to share. 🌈
